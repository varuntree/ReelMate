1. always add the comments for each section of the code generated by for me to understand the code better, and what it does.
2. Make the code modular and reusable, where possible. I might need to use or change the code in the future.
Project Overview:
I want to build a service that provides automatic faceless reel generation using AI. Here's how the process should work:

Prompt Submission:
Users will provide a text prompt describing the topic or content they want the reel to be about.

Video Generation Process:

Use stock video platforms (like Unsplash or Pexels) to retrieve relevant video clips based on the user's prompt.
Use an AI model to generate overlay text that aligns with the video's theme and purpose.
Convert the overlay text into speech using a text-to-voice AI model, which will serve as the background audio for the video.
Editing Features:
After the initial reel is automatically generated, users will have the ability to edit or customize the reel via a user-friendly interface. The editing options will include:

Changing the background video.
Modifying the overlay text (content and positioning).
Adjusting the placement of any elements in the video overlay.
Goal:
To provide a seamless AI-driven solution for creating and customizing engaging faceless reels for social media with minimal effort.
